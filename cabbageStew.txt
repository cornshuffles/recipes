Ingredients:
Stew meat (beef)- about 2-4lbs
some oil - vegetable preferred but other will work
1 head of cabage - smallish - not a big one
3 onions (smallish or 2 big ones)
1 large can of diced tomatoes (or 2 small ones)
1 larger carrot
1-2 teaspoons of paprika
5-10 whole peppercorns (if not, ground is fine)
1 table spoon of flower (this is to thicken it up little; I usually use 1 very very finely cut up potato; it will fall appart and not be visible but will thicken the stew with starches; flower will do the same)
1 peper (optional)
Sriracha sauce or something with  little kick (crushed red pepper ok or 1 hot peper whole)
salt

Prep:

1. Cut up onions in small cubes
2. Heat up oil in a large pot and add onions; caramelize them (fry them until they are soft/translusent); don't burn them
3. Add stew meat (or cubed meat of some kind) and fry for 5-10mins depending; stir and let the meet get mostly cooked; you want to get meet to release juices and be mostly cooked through
4. Add cutup carrot
5. Cut cabage in quarters first; cut out the middle root part from each quarter; cut further each piece into halves (for total of 8ths) and add to the pot
6. Add peper corn, paprika, cut up pepper, flower, canned tomatoes and whatever else is left (I think this is all)
7. Then add preferably hot water (boiled separately on the stove; not water heater water) so that everything is covered
8. Add salt (or some spice like that - ie Vegetta) to taste

Cover it and let it simmer on low heat for as long as you want; no less than 30-45mins; preferably 1+hrs.

That is it.
