Ingredients (4 servings):
40 ounces pork belly
8 half dollar sized slices ginger
4 green onion
4 cloves of garlic crushed
4 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons brown sugar
6 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce
6 tablespoons regular soy sauce
6 tablespoons rice wine
jasmine rice

Prep:

Step 1:
Cut pork belly into 2cm cubes.

Step 2:
Boil a pot of water large enough to dump all the pork in.
To the water, add pork, ginger, crushed garlic, and two of the green onions (chopped).
Bring the water back to a boil, then remove and strain only the pork.

Step 3:
Place 4 tablespoons olive oil in pan and heat on medium high heat.
Cook pork until seared and delicious.

Step 4:
Add brown sugar to the pork and reduce heat to low.
Cook until sugar has caramelized and coated the pork evenly.

Step 5:
Add in soy sauces and rice wine. Stir on medium heat until sauce has become a thick glaze.

Step 6:
Add ~400 ml water and stir until homogenous.
Partially cover and simmer for ~60 minutes. Stir every ~10 minutes.
Start the rice with about ~25 minutes of simmer left.
Uncover and reduce until sauce is a thick glaze. Should not be watery. Sometimes this takes a while.

Serve with rice.
