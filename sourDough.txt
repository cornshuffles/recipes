Ingredients:
Levain:
35g Sourdough starter - the older the better! Get one from someone who's sourdough you like...
35g Unbleached all purpose flour
35g Whole wheat flour
70g Water
Bread:
805g Bread flour
75g Whole wheat flour
690g Water
18g Salt

Prep: (This takes a whole day, start early...)

1.  Make the levain - add all the ingredients into an appropriately sized jar.
2.  Ferment the levain for ~5.5 hours.
3.  After 3 hours make the autolyse - add 660g water and all the flour. Mix just until hydrated - Don't over mix, it should still be pretty chunky looking. Cover and let rest with the levain for the remaining ~2.5 hours
4.  Pour the levain onto the autolysed dough, dimple it in and incorporate it.
5.  Dump the dough onto an unfloured workspace and slap and fold until smooth. (~5 mins)
6.  Cover and let sit for 25 mins.
7.  Add the salt and the remaining 30g of water. Incorporate and slap and fold until smooth. (~3 mins)
8.  Cover the dough and let rest. Now we're starting the bulk ferment. This will take ~4.5 hours. Rest 15 mins.
9.  Stretch and fold the dough. Rest 15 mins.
10. Stretch and fold the dough. Rest 15 mins.
11. Stretch and fold the dough. Rest 30 mins.
12. Stretch and fold the dough. Rest 30 mins.
13. Stretch and fold the dough. Rest 30 mins.
14. Stretch and fold the dough. Rest the remaining time for the bulk ferment. (2.25 hours)
15. Dump the dough onto an unfloured workspace. Split the dough into two halves with a dampened bench scraper. (Damp hands helps here)
16. Pre-shape the two doughs into loose boules - just lightly shape then, they don't need to be tight yet.
17. Let the loose boules rest for 20 mins uncovered on the workspace.
18. Flour the top of the boules then flip and shape them.
19. Place the shaped boules into floured bannetons with the seam side facing up.
20. Cover the bannetons and place them in the refrigerator for 12-15 hours.

Baking: (The next day)

21. Place a dutch oven (with lid!) into the kitchen oven and preheat to 500 degrees for an hour. The dutch oven needs at least this long to come all the way up to temp.
22. Flour the bottom of the loaf and dump it onto a floured workspace. Score the top of the loaf.
23. Pull the dutch oven out and lightly flour the bottom of it.
24. Place the scored loaf into the dutch oven, cover it with the lid and put it back into the kitchen oven.
25. Bake at 500 degrees with the lid on for 20 mins.
26. Remove the dutch oven lid and reduce the kitchen oven heat to 475 degrees. Bake for 25-30 mins, until dark brown.
27. Remove the dutch oven from the kitchen oven and dump out the loaf. Place onto a wire cooling rack and let cool until room temp. (It's important to let it cool all the way to room temp. The bread is still cooking during this time.)
28. Repeat the baking steps for the second loaf. (Make sure to preheat the dutch oven again)
