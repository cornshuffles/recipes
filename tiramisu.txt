2 tablespoons rum
2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies

Step 1:
In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator 1 hour.

Step 2:
In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form.

Step 3:
Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.

Step 4:
In a small bowl, combine coffee and rum. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with coffee mixture.
